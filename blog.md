### What computers can do for your oil & gas data that humans cannot

We often design hydraulic fracturing treatments around historical success. We look to the successes (and failures) of "[wildcatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcatter)" of the past and replicate treatment designs. Once we have a baseline treatment that tends to perform within a formation, we strive for continuous improvement, adjusting our baseline treatment in small, controlled ways, evaluating the efficacy of our adjustments. Said experiments are conducted by scientists, engineers, and statisticians in the lab and field with tools such as Excel, SpotFire, proprietary simulation software, and various programming languages. However, the full power of data is just beginning to be leveraged industry-wide, for two reasons:

1. Good datasets take time to accumulate.
2. The emergence of open-source tools (like [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) to the forefront of data science has leveled the playing field for advanced analytics among startups and super majors alike.

#### Machine Learning — What’s the hype about?
Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have stirred quite a bit of commotion lately, with mainstream news articles referencing Facebook’s chatbot AI that “[created its own language](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-develops-its-own-non-human-language/530436/)” and [Elon Musk urging regulators](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk) to be proactive in controlling AI development. We’re in an era where the data being collected is allowing engineers to perform machine learning algorithms that learn patterns in data at scale in ways humans can't fathom (e.g. processing 100+ million rows of data, synthesizing data in more than 3 dimensions, combining variables in non-linear fashions).

[Robots have been taught to cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLJyUmuP6Qg) by watching YouTube and computer vision models can now diagnose brain tumors in ways that physicians cannot. So it doesn't seem outrageous that we could generate novel, low-cost frac treatments that have high production potential or use frac van time series data to find pressure patterns that indicate a potential screen out before a seasoned engineer or treater may be able to.

Well Data Labs is enabling leaders in the oil and gas industry to store and navigate their high-frequency data with ease, allowing completions engineers, geologists, and analysts to take the leap into advanced analytics and begin tip-toeing into the world of machine learning.

#### How machine learning can be applied in oil & gas?
The realm of machine learning in oil & gas isn't limited to production optimization either. Leaders in the field are predicting field equipment failure from vibrational data, creating vehicle routing optimization algorithms to prioritize which wells pumpers should travel to next, and using natural language processing to analyze engineering/treater notes to predict which well sites are  high risk candidates for safety incidents.

Data science is moving the oil & gas industry from being reactive to proactive. But here's the catch -- we need people with oil & gas domain expertise building these algorithms! The oilfield is a complex and nuanced place and building predictive models and developing meaningful statistics is difficult with domain experience. Tools like Tableau will take you far, but if you're looking to elevate your skillset,  programming is a requirement. Python and R are and the languages of data science and machine learning.

#### How to get started with data analytics using Python?
Python is programming language. Within Python, are something called modules. Modules are a composed of code someone has written to make your life easier. For the Excel users out there, imagine having to write a VLookup function with VBA code every time you wanted it’s functionality. Modules make it easy to perform common tasks in a few lines of code and are optimized for computation speed.
Below I write code in Python by interacting with two modules — pandas and seaborn. Pandas is an Excel-like module for big data and enhanced manipulation. Seaborn is a tool for creating beautiful charts and visuals. If you gain comfort with Python and these modules, machine learning is not far away (look to a module called scikit-learn and this blog post to get started). Here’s an online environment where you can try writing some code yourself without having to install Python.

Using frac stage data extracted from Well Data Labs, in just a few lines of code I’m able to….



#### Wrapping it Up
The barrier of entry to advanced analytics has never been lower. You can use the same analytics tools that are literally used by leading researchers around the world. The amount of data that oil & gas companies collect and high-stakes decisions make the industry one of the most exciting for data science and machine learning.
